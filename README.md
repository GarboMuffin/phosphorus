# forkphorus

[forkphorus.github.io](https://forkphorus.github.io)

A JavaScript/TypeScript compiler for Scratch 2 and Scratch 3 projects. forkphorus is a *fork* of phos*phorus*.

## Build Steps

Forkphorus is mostly written in TypeScript, which must be compiled to JavaScript to run in the browser.

 * Install node.js and npm (usually included with node.js)
 * [Install TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links)
 * Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run `tsc` (to build once) or `tsc -w` (to automatically rebuild when you make changes)

If you only wish to play around or test a bug fix, then feel free to instead edit phosphorus.dist.js directly.
